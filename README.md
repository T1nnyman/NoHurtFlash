Tired of the blinding red hurt flash every time a mob takes damage, especially when using shaders? NoHurtFlash disables the default red overlay and replaces it with a sleek, customizable glow effect — making hurt entities easier to see without ruining the look of your mobs.

❌ Disables the default red hurt flash overlay for all entities

✨ Adds a glowing outline when an entity is hurt (customizable) / (optional)

✔️ Works with vanilla and modded mobs, including GeckoLib-based entities

💡 Lightweight, client-side only — safe for any server!
